Dev Setup
Follow these steps to setup your dev environment:

Checkout securereader git repo

Init and update git submodules

git submodule update --init --recursive

Fix support library mismatch

ActionBarSherlock uses an outdated version of the support library. We must use the same version of the library in BigBuffalo and ABS.

Command Line

 ./fix-support-library.sh
Ignore the rm: external/CacheWord/cachewordlib/libs/guava-r09.jar: No such file or directory error

Manually

Copy app/libs/android-support-v4.jar to external/HoloEverywhere/contrib/ActionBarSherlock/actionbarsherlock/libs/android-support-v4.jar and to external/CacheWord/cachewordlib/libs/android-support-v4.jar

Build Project

Using Eclipse

I recommend using a new workspace in Eclipse. I recommend using the root of this repo.

Run Android SDK Manager from ADT-Eclipse and make sure that you have SDK Platform Api Level 16 installed. If not then install those and restart the eclipse environment.

Import into Eclipse (using the File -> Import -> Android -> "Existing Android Code Into Workspace" option) the projects in the following order. Do not check "Copy projects into workspace".

Note: The import order is crucial! (ps Order may not be crucial anymore)

 app/
 external/CacheWord/cachewordlib
 external/HoloEverywhere/contrib/ActionBarSherlock/actionbarsherlock
 external/HoloEverywhere/library
 external/OnionKit/libonionkit
 external/securereaderlibrary
 external/bho/TibetanTextLibrary
When importing app/ double click on the value "MainActivity" and change it to "Secure Reader" under the New Project Name heading before finishing the import.

Using command line

 ./setup-ant.sh
 cd app/
 ant clean debug
Troubleshooting
Eclipse complains about overlapping an existing project when importing

Make sure the project isn't in your workspace, if it is delete it (right click -> delete)
Close eclipse completely
Open the directory you're importing and delete .project, .settings/, .classpath
Restart eclipse, and import the project as an existing Android project
(sometimes an additional open/restart cycle is required to clear Eclipse's project cache)

Invalid Project Description

This is another occurrence of the previous problem, see above.
